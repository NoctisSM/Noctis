            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Invisalign, the pioneer in clear aligner orthodontic treatment, needed to redesign its main website to better serve prospective patients navigating their journey from awareness to consultation. The existing website, while informative, presented several challenges for users trying to understand treatment options, costs, and the process of getting started with Invisalign.</p>

            <p>As the lead designer and researcher on this project, I was tasked with creating a more intuitive, engaging, and conversion-focused experience that would help potential patients feel confident about choosing Invisalign while reducing the friction points in the path to booking a consultation with a provider.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Through preliminary research and stakeholder interviews, we identified several critical issues with the existing Invisalign website that were impacting user experience and conversion rates.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Complex navigation structure made it difficult for users to find essential information about treatment options and pricing</li>
                <li>Overwhelming amount of technical information presented without clear hierarchy or progressive disclosure</li>
                <li>Lack of personalized guidance based on individual concerns and treatment goals</li>
                <li>Unclear path to finding a provider and booking consultations</li>
                <li>Limited social proof and patient testimonials to build trust and confidence</li>
                <li>Mobile experience that felt cramped and difficult to navigate</li>
                <li>Inconsistent messaging about treatment duration, costs, and what to expect</li>
            </ul>

            <div style="text-align: center; padding: 40px 0; font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500; margin: 40px 0; border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1); border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);">
                How might we redesign the Invisalign website to provide clear, personalized guidance that helps prospective patients understand their options and confidently take the next step toward treatment?

            <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>I conducted an in-depth competitive analysis of direct competitors in the clear aligner space to understand what was working well and where opportunities existed for differentiation. I analyzed SmileDirectClub and OrthoFX, examining their information architecture, visual design, messaging strategy, and user flows from landing page to consultation booking.</p>

            <h3>Key Changes to Navigation</h3>
            <ul>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Wireframes and Prototyping</h2>
            <p>I created comprehensive wireframes for key user flows, starting with low-fidelity sketches to explore layout options and progressing to high-fidelity interactive prototypes for usability testing.</p>

            <h3>Homepage Redesign</h3>
            <p>The new homepage focuses on helping users quickly find the information most relevant to their needs. Rather than presenting all information at once, it offers multiple entry points based on common user goals.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            <p>I conducted three rounds of usability testing with the interactive prototype, testing with 18 participants across different demographic groups. Each session focused on key user flows and gathered both qualitative feedback and quantitative task success metrics.</p>

            <h3>Testing Methodology</h3>
            <p>Participants were given scenario-based tasks such as determining if Invisalign could treat their specific dental concern, finding a nearby provider with weekend availability, and understanding total treatment costs, including financing options. I used a combination of moderated remote sessions and unmoderated testing through UserTesting to gather diverse feedback.</p>

            <h3>Key Findings</h3>

            <h4 style="margin: 32px 0 16px;">Round One Insights</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The Smile Assessment Tool was well received but needed a clearer explanation of what happens after completion</li>
                <li>Users wanted to see pricing earlier in their journey rather than after exploring treatment options</li>
                <li>Provider profile information was helpful, but users wanted more photos of the actual office environment</li>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>Ensuring the redesigned website was accessible to all users was a core priority throughout the design process. I conducted comprehensive accessibility audits and worked to exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards.</p>

            <h3>Accessibility Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All color combinations tested for contrast ratios meeting at least AA standards, with most exceeding AAA</li>
                <li>Interactive elements designed with focus states and keyboard navigation in mind</li>
                <li>All imagery includes descriptive alt text, particularly important for before and after treatment photos</li>
                <li>Form inputs include clear labels and error messages with specific guidance for correction</li>
                <li>Video content includes captions and transcripts for patient testimonials</li>
                <li>Responsive design tested with screen readers, including JAWS and VoiceOver</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>PROJECT SUMMARY AND REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>This nine-month journey redesigning the Invisalign main website was one of the most complex and rewarding projects of my career. It required balancing multiple stakeholder perspectives from clinical advisors and marketing teams to orthodontist partners and prospective patients who would use the site to make important healthcare decisions.</p>

            <p>One of the biggest challenges was finding the right balance between providing comprehensive information and avoiding overwhelming users. Through multiple rounds of testing and iteration, I learned that users do not need to understand everything about Invisalign technology to feel confident in their decision. They need to understand how it will work for their specific situation and that they are working with qualified professionals.</p>

            <p>The competitive analysis revealed interesting insights about positioning in the clear aligner market. While competitors emphasized either convenience or clinical credentials, Invisalign had the opportunity to own the middle ground of being both accessible and premium. The redesign strategy focused on making the experience feel approachable while leveraging decades of clinical research as a key differentiator.</p>

            <p>Persona development and journey mapping proved invaluable throughout the project. Jessica and Robert became real people to our team, and we constantly asked ourselves whether our design decisions would serve their needs. The journey maps revealed critical emotional moments where users needed reassurance, guiding where we placed trust building elements like patient testimonials and provider credentials.</p>

            <p>The Smile Assessment Tool emerged as one of the most impactful features from a user perspective. During testing, we saw how powerful it was for users to receive personalized guidance early in their journey. Many participants expressed that the tool helped them understand their candidacy and feel less overwhelmed by the amount of information on the site.</p>

            <p>Usability testing provided some of the most valuable insights into the project. Watching real users interact with the designs revealed assumptions I had made and pain points I had not anticipated. The iterative testing process taught me the importance of being open to feedback and willing to rethink even designs I was proud of. Task success rates improved from 67% to 94%, and average time to book consultations decreased from 8 minutes to 3.5 minutes.</p>

            <p>This project deepened my appreciation for the role of content strategy in user experience design. Working closely with content designers and clinical advisors to craft clear, empathetic messaging was just as important as the visual and interaction design. The tone needed to be authoritative without being intimidating, friendly without being casual, and honest without being discouraging.</p>

            <p>Looking back, I am proud of how the redesigned website addresses core user needs while supporting business goals around consultation bookings and brand positioning. However, I also recognize areas for improvement. More early involvement of orthodontist partners would have surfaced clinical considerations sooner, and additional testing with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds would have provided richer insights into how different audiences perceive value in healthcare decisions.</p>

            <p>This project reinforced my belief that great design comes from deep empathy and rigorous process. Understanding users as whole people with complex needs, fears, and aspirations rather than just task completers led to solutions that genuinely serve them. Most importantly, I learned that designing for healthcare decisions requires an extra level of care and responsibility, which shaped every design decision and will inform how I approach future healthcare design challenges.</p>
