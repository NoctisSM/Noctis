            <div class="section-label">Project Overview</div>
            <p class="story-intro">I redesigned Invisalign's primary marketing website to convert prospective patients into scheduled consultations, addressing confusion about pricing, treatment candidacy, and provider selection.</p>
            <p class="story-text">Invisalign.com served as the first touchpoint for millions of prospective patients researching clear aligner treatment, yet the site struggled to answer fundamental questions about cost, eligibility, and how to begin treatment. Users abandoned the site without booking consultations because they couldn't find transparent pricing information, felt overwhelmed by clinical terminology and dense content, and encountered a frustrating provider search experience that failed to match them with appropriate orthodontists. I led the complete redesign from research through final implementation, working with content strategists and clinical advisors to transform the site from an information repository into a conversion-focused patient acquisition tool.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-label">Role & Context</div>
            <p class="story-text">I served as lead designer and researcher on this project, working independently on design while collaborating closely with content strategists, clinical advisors, and engineering teams. My responsibilities encompassed competitive analysis of dental and medical service websites, user research with 42 prospective patients through surveys and interviews, information architecture redesign to surface critical decision making information, interaction and visual design for key conversion flows, and usability testing across three rounds with 18 participants. Working on a healthcare marketing website taught me to balance clinical accuracy with accessibility. Every piece of content needed approval from dental professionals to ensure medical accuracy, yet that same content had to remain comprehensible to users with no dental knowledge. This tension between expertise and approachability shaped every design decision, from terminology choices to information density to visual hierarchy.</p>

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-label">The Problem</div>
            <h2>Prospective patients abandon without scheduling consultations</h2>
            <p>Research with 42 prospective patients revealed three critical barriers to conversion. First, pricing opacity created immediate distrust. Users wanted upfront cost estimates to determine if treatment fit their budget, yet the existing site buried pricing information deep in FAQ sections or avoided it entirely, forcing users to schedule consultations just to learn if treatment was financially feasible. This lack of transparency drove users to competitor sites or third-party review platforms to find pricing information, often never returning to Invisalign.</p>
            <p>Second, the site overwhelmed users with clinical details before addressing basic eligibility questions. Dense paragraphs about treatment mechanics and orthodontic terminology appeared before users could determine if they even qualified for treatment. Prospective patients wanted a simple answer to "Will this work for me?" before investing time learning about the process. The existing site assumed clinical interest that most users didn't have, creating cognitive overload that led to abandonment.</p>
            <p>Third, the provider search functionality frustrated users at the critical moment of conversion. After learning about treatment and pricing, users needed to find a qualified local provider, but the search tool returned generic lists without filters for insurance acceptance, patient reviews, or provider expertise. Users couldn't differentiate between orthodontists, forcing them to visit multiple provider websites or call offices directly to gather basic information. This friction at the final conversion step meant users who were otherwise ready to schedule consultations gave up in frustration.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-label">The Solution</div>
            <h2>Personalized pathways with transparent information</h2>
            <p>The redesigned information architecture prioritized answering the three fundamental questions users needed answered before booking consultations: cost, candidacy, and provider selection. Pricing information moved from buried FAQ sections to the homepage and key decision pages, with transparent ranges and insurance guidance. A simplified eligibility section replaced dense clinical content, using accessible language and visual examples to help users quickly determine candidacy. The provider search received a complete overhaul with filtering by insurance, specialization, patient ratings, and availability, plus integrated booking directly from search results.</p>
            <p>The core innovation was the Smile Assessment Tool, an interactive questionnaire that personalized the entire website experience. Users answered questions about their treatment goals, concerns, and dental history, then received customized recommendations including likely treatment duration, estimated cost ranges based on their specific case, matched providers who specialized in their needs, and personalized content addressing their stated concerns. This tool transformed the site from generic information delivery to personalized guidance, building confidence while accelerating the path to consultation booking.</p>
            <p>The visual design supported conversion through clarity and trust building. Clean typography and generous white space reduced cognitive load compared to the dense existing site. High-quality patient photography showcased real results without clinical sterility. Progressive disclosure patterns revealed detailed information only when users explicitly requested it, preventing overwhelm while maintaining depth for users who wanted comprehensive details. Every interaction was designed to move users closer to scheduling a consultation while respecting their need for thorough information gathering.</p>

            <h2>Dramatic improvements in conversion metrics</h2>
            <p>The redesigned website delivered substantial improvements across all key conversion metrics. Task success rates improved from 67% to 94% across critical user flows, including finding pricing information, determining treatment candidacy, and locating appropriate providers. Average time to book consultations decreased from 8 minutes to 3.5 minutes, a 56% reduction indicating reduced friction in the conversion path. User confidence scores increased by 43% when asked about understanding treatment options and costs, demonstrating that the simplified information architecture successfully built trust while maintaining educational depth. The Smile Assessment Tool achieved 73% completion rate among users who started it, with users who completed the assessment converting to consultation bookings at 2.3 times the rate of users who skipped it. These metrics validated that personalization and transparency were critical drivers of healthcare consumer conversion, lessons that informed Invisalign's broader digital strategy for patient acquisition.</p>
