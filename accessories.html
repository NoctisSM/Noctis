            <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
            <p>I opened and then analyzed these three websites, one of which is a direct competitor and two are indirect. I compared the ordering experience of each website as a new user and a returning user. What's more is I juxtaposed negative comments from the App Store and Android App Store to get the essence of what the users struggle with the most while using them and what they are not too keen on.</p>

            <p>Once the initial flow was completed and the wireframes were ready, I started creating a couple of the main screens of the app. Using the company's brand guidelines was the most important thing. I created a simple <strong>UI Style Guide</strong> to maintain consistency. Thus, for colors, I went with the <strong>HSL color model</strong> to get exact tints and shadows of the main colors. Then I created a <strong>typography scale</strong> to ensure the hierarchy throughout the project is preserved.</p>

            <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
            <p>I then created UX storyboards for one persona to help me visually predict and explore a user's experience with my website. These were created using the Storyboard Mix-and-match plugin via Figma</p>

                <p style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 32px;">Julia is about to leave the house and wonders if her favorite store will be cramped as always. → Julia is in front of the store, where there is already a very long queue, and is angry, as are other clients. → Julia sees an advert on the storefront that the bakery has just launched a new website that lets you order goodies and collect them at a convenient time. → Julia downloads the newly launched website and creates a new account. She also adds her payment method. → Julia orders her favorite clothes and pays via the website. Her order will be ready in 2 hours, or she has the option to ship it to her house. → Julia collects her order and is happy that it took quickly to complete. Now she won't be late for rush hour traffic.</p>

            <h2>Prototype validation</h2>
            <p>After the prototype was created, I tested it on 5 users. I made a research plan where I outlined research goals, questions I wanted to know the answer from, KPIs, methodology, information about the participants, and a script with tasks to complete. Mainly I wanted to be sure that the ordering process was smooth without any friction and leads to the product being purchased and that later the user knows when and how the product can be picked up. This was tested and carried on in-person using Figma's prototype mirror share app.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The tasks included adding one item and then more items into the cart, multiplying the product's quantity, and then proceeding to the checkout screen and completing the order. Side tasks included toggling the description tab and using coupon codes. Throughout the tasks, I asked users to talk through their thought process and speak out when something was unclear or irritated them.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">After the usability study, I asked the participants to complete a short System Usability Scale questionnaire.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">After collecting insights from the participants, I made an affinity diagram to organize a large number of ideas into their natural relationships.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Then I made a usability study presentation to showcase the study's insights and recommendations.</p>

            <h3>Study results</h3>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>60% of participants</strong> (3 out of 5) weren't able to purchase any product(s). However, all of the users were able to add the desired items to their carts, use coupon codes, and toggle the description button. The main friction of these two users who couldn't purchase the product(s) was that they weren't aware that paying through the website is only possible by owning a credit card.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">In a later update, PayPal and Stripe were added to satisfy customer frustration.</p>

            <h2>Accessibility check</h2>
            <p>The app has been evaluated for contrast to match at least AA standards. Every frame was checked with contrast checker tools, such as the Figma plugin "A11y - Color Contrast Checker" and then by hand with the "Contrast Checker" by WebAIM.</p>

            <h2>Wireframes and initial insights</h2>
            <p>Once the flow diagram was established, I started sketching with pen and paper the low-fidelity wireframes of the main user flow. However, due to space constraints, I decided to show only a couple of the digital lo-fi wireframes I designed. The initial wireframes were made to adapt to the Apple users (as a form of following the Material Design's guidelines).</p>

            <h2>PROJECT SUMMARY</h2>
            <p>During this 10-month journey working on the Invisalign e-commerce website, I had the opportunity to tackle a comprehensive UX/UI design project that encompassed the entire design process from initial research through final implementation. This project was both demanding and incredibly rewarding, providing me with invaluable insights into creating user-centered digital experiences in the medical e-commerce space.</p>

            <p>The project began with extensive market research to understand the landscape of e-commerce websites during the COVID-19 pandemic. I conducted competitive analyses of major retail platforms, including Bloomingdale's, Asos, and Nike, examining their strengths and weaknesses to identify opportunities for improvement. Through user surveys with 27 participants and detailed persona development, I gained deep insights into what users truly value when shopping online: price, delivery time, product information, and ease of use.</p>

            <p>One of the most valuable aspects of this project was creating detailed user journey maps and understanding the emotional highs and lows customers experience during their shopping journey. Mapping out Julia's frustrations with in-store shopping—from long queues to time constraints which helped me identify clear opportunities for an online solution that would eliminate these pain points. The storyboarding process allowed me to visualize how the website would fit seamlessly into users' lives, transforming a frustrating shopping experience into a convenient, time-saving solution.</p>

            <p>The design phase involved creating comprehensive wireframes, developing a cohesive design system aligned with Invisalign's brand guidelines, and building high-fidelity prototypes. I paid special attention to accessibility, ensuring all designs met AA contrast standards. The use of Invisalign's colorful brand palette helped establish a friendly, approachable feeling that was essential for creating trust in a medical product e-commerce platform.</p>

            <p>The prototype validation phase proved to be one of the most enlightening parts of the project. Testing with 5 users revealed a critical insight: 60% of participants couldn't complete purchases because they were unaware that only credit cards were accepted. This finding led to a significant improvement by adding PayPal and Stripe as payment options, which demonstrated the immense value of user testing in identifying and solving real problems before launch.</p>

            <p>Throughout this project, I learned that great design is iterative and user-focused. Every decision, from the information architecture to the checkout flow, needed to be validated with real users. I became proficient in various UX research methodologies, including surveys, interviews, usability testing, and affinity mapping. I also deepened my understanding of accessibility standards and the importance of creating inclusive digital experiences.</p>

            <p>While I'm proud of what was accomplished, I recognize there's always room for growth and improvement. The field of UX/UI design is constantly evolving, and this project taught me the importance of staying curious, being open to feedback, and always advocating for the end user. The skills and insights I gained from this project, from research and strategy to visual design and testing, have been instrumental in shaping my approach to design challenges.</p>

            <p>Looking back, this project reinforced my passion for creating meaningful digital experiences that solve real problems for real people. The transition from identifying user pain points to delivering a solution that makes their lives easier is what makes UX design so fulfilling. I'm grateful for the opportunity to have worked on a project that not only challenged me professionally but also contributed to making medical products more accessible through thoughtful, user-centered design.</p>
