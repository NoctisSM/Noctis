            <div class="section-label">Project Overview</div>
            <p class="story-intro">I designed an e-commerce platform for Invisalign accessories during the COVID-19 pandemic, enabling contactless shopping when patients needed treatment supplies but faced store closures and safety concerns.</p>
            <p class="story-text">The pandemic accelerated demand for digital purchasing of medical products, yet Invisalign lacked a direct-to-consumer e-commerce channel for replacement retainers, cleaning supplies, and treatment accessories. Patients relied on in-person visits to orthodontist offices or dental retailers, creating friction in the purchasing journey and abandoned treatment due to difficulty obtaining supplies. I designed a complete e-commerce platform from research through final implementation, balancing ease of use with the trust requirements necessary for medical product purchases online.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-label">Role & Context</div>
            <p class="story-text">I served as the sole UX/UI designer on this project, working independently to research, design, and deliver the full e-commerce experience. My role encompassed competitive analysis of leading retail platforms, user surveys and interviews to understand purchasing priorities, interaction and visual design aligned with Invisalign's brand guidelines, usability testing with real patients, and accessibility evaluation to meet WCAG AA standards. Working on a medical e-commerce platform taught me how trust building differs from traditional retail. Every design decision, from payment options to product information density to error messaging, needed to reinforce credibility while maintaining the simplicity users expected from modern shopping experiences. This tension between comprehensive information and streamlined checkout became the central design challenge.</p>

            <div class="project-card-highlight">
                <h3>Conducted research with 27 survey participants and analyzed competitor platforms including Bloomingdale's, Asos, and Nike to identify best practices and common friction points in e-commerce checkout flows.</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="project-card-highlight">

            <div class="project-card-highlight">

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-label">The Problem</div>
            <h2>Pandemic barriers to essential treatment supplies</h2>
            <p>Research revealed that 40% of patients prioritized price transparency when shopping online, while 20% emphasized fast delivery times. User reviews from competitor platforms highlighted critical pain points: customers hated re-entering payment information on every purchase, needed the ability to quickly reorder frequently purchased items, and wanted immediately accessible customer support. For medical products specifically, users expressed heightened anxiety about product authenticity, return policies, and delivery reliability compared to general retail purchases.</p>
            <p>The competitive analysis uncovered a consistent pattern. Leading e-commerce platforms excelled at visual presentation and checkout efficiency but often neglected accessibility standards, with text contrast ratios below WCAG AA requirements. Generic preset configurations felt impersonal and lacked the educational content users needed to make confident decisions about medical products. Sites with slow loading times or inadequate search functionality saw higher abandonment rates, particularly on mobile devices where patients often researched and purchased treatment supplies.</p>
            <p>The core business problem was clear: without a functioning e-commerce channel, Invisalign risked treatment abandonment as patients struggled to obtain necessary supplies during pandemic restrictions. Existing phone and email ordering processes created delays and friction, while directing patients to third-party retailers sacrificed brand control and customer data insights. The solution needed to reduce purchasing friction while building enough trust for patients to confidently buy medical products without in-person validation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-label">The Solution</div>
            <h2>Streamlined purchasing with medical-grade trust signals</h2>
            <p>The e-commerce platform prioritized clarity and speed while incorporating trust-building elements essential for medical product purchases. The information architecture organized products into intuitive categories with powerful search and filtering capabilities. Each product page balanced comprehensive specifications with clean visual hierarchy, featuring high-quality photography, detailed descriptions of materials and usage instructions, customer reviews and ratings to build social proof, and clear shipping and return policies. The design system drew from Invisalign's existing brand guidelines, using the HSL color model for precise color management and establishing a typography scale that maintained hierarchy across all contexts.</p>
            <p>The checkout flow eliminated common friction points identified during research. Users could save payment methods securely for faster future purchases, quickly reorder previous items without searching, access customer support through prominently placed contact options, and receive automated order tracking and delivery notifications. The key innovation was offering multiple payment methods beyond credit cards. Usability testing revealed that 60% of users couldn't complete purchases when limited to credit card payment, a problem immediately solved by adding PayPal and Stripe integration.</p>
            <p>Accessibility wasn't an afterthought but a core requirement. Every screen met WCAG AA contrast standards, verified through both automated tools and manual checking. Form fields included clear labels and error messages, button sizes met minimum touch target requirements for mobile devices, and the entire flow worked seamlessly with keyboard navigation and screen readers. This attention to accessibility wasn't just ethical, it expanded the potential customer base to include users with visual or motor impairments who might otherwise abandon the purchase flow.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-section">
            <div class="section-label">Impact</div>
            <h2>Measurable conversion improvements and reduced friction</h2>
            <p>The platform launch delivered significant improvements in conversion and user satisfaction. Purchase completion rates improved by 60% after adding PayPal and Stripe payment options, validating that payment method flexibility was critical for medical e-commerce conversion. The streamlined product catalog and search functionality reduced time to purchase, while clear product information and trust signals decreased pre-purchase support inquiries. Post-launch surveys indicated high user confidence in the platform, with patients reporting they would continue using the e-commerce channel even after pandemic restrictions lifted. The project demonstrated that medical e-commerce requires heightened attention to trust building, accessibility, and payment flexibility compared to traditional retail, lessons that informed Invisalign's broader digital commerce strategy.</p>
